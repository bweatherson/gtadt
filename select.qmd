# Selection {#sec-select}

Some decision theories, most notably EDT, output a valuation of all possible choices. From that valuation a preference function over choices can be easily generated; choices that are more highly valued are preferred to those that are less highly valued. Indeed, that preference ordering will be a total preorder. Other theories, especially the theories that recommend Gathering in Stag Decisions, do not output valuations of all choices, but they do output a preference ordering over all choices. In some cases that is a total preorder, but often it is simply a preorder. Still, they share with EDT the idea that a decision theory outputs a preference ordering over the choices.

GDT rejects this assumption. The aim of a decision theory is to say what the idealised chooser will choose, given some options. It is not to say that this unchosen option is 7th best, and that unchosen one is 9th best. It can't be that, because these claims don't explain behaviour, and explaining behaviour is the aim of the project. One does not behave differently whether this or that unchosen option is preferred.

So we should think of GDT as outputting not a preference function, but a choice function in the sense of @Samuelson1938, @Chernoff1954, and @Sen1971. This is consistent with the practice in decision theory. Think about the use of solution concepts like subgame perfect equilibrium [@Bonanno2018, sec 4.4] or Perfect Bayesian equilibrium [@Bonanno2018, ch. 13]. These describe which choices are acceptable in dynamic situations. But they don't even purport to offer a ranking over the unchosen options. The algorithms one uses to solve games using these concepts don't suggest that this or that unchosen option is better than some others. All the theory says is that given a situation, these options are choice-worthy, and these ones are not.

That doesn't mean that anything goes when it comes to choice. We can put some substantive constraints on what a choice function looks like. Following standard practice, when _X_ is a set of options, let _c_(_X_) be the set of choice-worthy options in _X_. One plausible principle is that if _Y_ is a subset of _X_, i.e., it is generated from _X_ by deleting alternatives, then anything in _c_(_X_) that is also in _Y_ is in _c_(_Y_). That is, deleting options does not turn something choice-worthy into something non-choice-worthy, unless it is indeed deleted. This is called principle $\alpha$ by @Sen1971, though it is often also (following @Moulin1985) called the Chernoff condition, since it is equivalent to one of Chernoff's postulates. And this principle is important in game theory, for without it the method of solving games by deleting rejected options would not make sense.

- Solution concepts are not preference ordering
- Talk about Sen for a bit, and how there are principled constraints on selection functions
- One reason why not preference ordering: Indecisiveness. The permissible choices are not things the chooser is indifferent between
- Another, better, reason why not preference ordering: doesn't play an explanatory role. 
- Possible objection: It does play an explanatory role, it explains what they would do with fewer choices.
- This is I think the most important point, and it's why I've put off this discussion for so long.
- First reply: Gotta specify whether the loss of option is common knowledge or not, and both answers have flaws
- Second reply: Taking away mixed strategies might take us out of the realm of rational choice (if I'm right in mixed strategies chapter)
- Third reply: Taking away some strategies in dynamic cases might be really weird.
- Example: Two rounds. At each round a $1 bill is on table, and Chooser takes it or leaves it.
- What does it mean to remove the strategy TTT, i.e., take at R1, and then take at R2 whether you take or leave at R1.
- Counter: This is an artifact of the definition of strategies
- My reply: Need this definition of strategies to explain simple (3 step) centipede problems
- Counter: Stalnaker says that this is wrong
- My reply: Eh, that's a point. I disagree here, but whatever
- This is why I reject strategic form normal form
