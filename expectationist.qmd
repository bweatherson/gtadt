# Expectationist {#sec-expect}

There is a strange split in contemporary decision theory. On the one hand, there are questions about the way to model attitudes to risk, largely organised around the challenge to orthodoxy from @Quiggin1982 and @BuchakRisk. On the other hand, there are questions about what to do in cases where the states are causally but not probabilistically independent of one's actions, with the central case being Newcomb's Problem [@Nozick1969]. The strange split is that these two literatures have almost nothing in common.[^expectationist-1]

[^expectationist-1]: There is a survey article from a few years ago - @Elliot2019 - that has summaries of the then state-of-the-art on these two questions. And it makes it very striking how little the literatures on each of them overlap.

This split might seem to make sense when one reflects that there is no logical difficulty in endorsing any prominent answer to one set of questions with any prominent answer to the other set. But things get more difficult quickly. For one thing, one answer to questions about risk, what I'll call the expectationist answer, is universally assumed by people working on issues around Newcomb's Problem. For another, the argument forms used in the two debates are similar, and that should affect how the two arguments go. 

Say that a normal decision problem is one where the states are probabilistically independent of the choices. A simple example is betting on a coin flip. In talking about normal decision problems I'll normally label the states H, for Heads, or T for Tails. Unless otherwise stated coins are fair, so H and T are equiprobable. 

Say that an abnormal decision problem is simply one that isn't normal. A simple example is where the states are predictions of an arbitrarily accurate predictor. I'll normally label such states as PX, where X is a choice the agent may make. In these cases the Predictor is arbitrarily accurate unless otherwise stated, but we will spend some time with more error prone predictors. 

The view I call expectationism has two parts. First, it says that in normal decision problems, the rational agent maximises the expected value of something like the value of their action. Second, it says that something like this expected value plays an important role in the theory of abnormal decision problems. These definitions are vague, so there are possible borderline cases. But in practice this doesn't arise, at least in the philosophy literature. Everyone working on abnormal problems is an expectationist. Indeed, most work assumes without even saying it that the first clause of expectationism is correct. Everyone working on normal problems makes it clear which side they fall on, so there is no vagueness there. And every game theory text is expectationist. 

I'm going to mostly follow suit. So why am I belabouring this point? One small reason and one large reason. The small reason is that one of the arguments I'll give concerning abnormal cases generalises to an argument for expectationism about normal cases. The other reason is dialectical.

In the debate about normal cases, the method of gathering intuitions about cases, and seeing which theory fits the intuitions best, does not favour expectationism. On the contrary, the Quiggin-Buchak theory does a much better job on that score. There is something incoherent about assuming expectationism is true for normal cases, and then thinking that the right way to theorise about abnormal cases is asking which theory fits intuitions best. If that's the goal of decision theory, we shouldn't be expectationist to start with.

The argument for expectationism is not that it fits the intuitions about cases best, but that it's the only theory that is compatible with various highly plausible principles, such as the Sure Thing Principle. Again, the theorist working on abnormal cases who is an expectationist has a dialectical burden here. They don't have to believe in the Sure Thing Principle, and indeed many expectationists don't [@Gallownd]. But they do have to believe in some principle that can be used to make an argument for expectationism. Especially when it comes to evidential decision theorists, I'm not sure what that principle might be. Still, I don't have an argument that there is no such principle, so I'll just note this is a challenge, not any kind of refutation.

Expectationism has a big practical advantage; it lets us treat the payouts in a game table as expected values, not any kind of final value. This is useful because it is very rare that a decision problem results in outcomes that have anything like final value. Often we are thinking about decision problems where the payouts are in dollars, or some other currency. That's to say, we are often considering gambles whose payout is another gamble. Holding some currency is a bet against inflation; in general, the value of currency is typically highly uncertain.[^expectationist-2] For the expectationist, this is not a serious theoretical difficulty. As long as a dollar, or a euro, or a peso, has an expected value, we can sensibly talk about decision problems with payouts in those currencies. Depending on just how the non-expectationist thinks about compound gambles, they might have a much harder time handling even simple money bets.[^expectationist-3]

[^expectationist-2]: See @Alcoba2023 for what happens when people start thinking that bet is a bad one.

[^expectationist-3]: Joanna @Thoma2019 develops a subtle critique of some non-expectationist theories starting with something like this point.
