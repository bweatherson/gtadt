# Introduction {#sec-intro .unnumbered}

Textbook versions of game theory embed a distinctive approach to decision theory. That theory isn't always made explicit, and it isn't always clear how it handles some cases. But we can extract one interesting and plausible theory, which I'll call Gamified Decision Theory (GDT), from these textbooks. There are nine characteristics of GDT (as I'll understand it) that I will focus on. I'll quickly list them here, then the bulk of the paper will consist of a section on each of the nine characteristics.

1.  **Idealised**; GDT is a theory of what ideal deciders do.
2.  **Expectationist**; the ideal decider prefers getting more expected value to getting less.
3.  **Causal**; GDT is a variety of Causal Decision Theory (CDT).
4.  **Allows Mixtures**; the ideal decider can perform a probabilistic mixture of any acts they can perform.
5.  **Ratificationist**; the ideal decider endorses the decisions they make.
6.  **Indecisive**; GDT sometimes says that multiple options are permissible, and they are not equally good.
7.  **Dual Mandate**; in a dynamic choice, the ideal decider will follow a plan that's permissible, and take choices at every stage that are permissible.
8.  **Substantive Probability**; the ideal decider has rational credences.
9.  **Weak Dominance, Once**; the ideal decider will not choose weakly dominated options, but they may choose options that would not survive iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies.

This is not going to be a work of exegesis, poring over game theory texts to show that they really do endorse all of 1-9. In fact it wouldn't take much work to show that they endorse 1-5, so the work wouldn't be worth doing. And while some books endorse 8 and 9, it would take a lot more investigative work than I'm going to do here to show that anything like a majority of them do. It would be interesting, but not obviously a philosophical question, to see what proportion endorse 6 and 7. But I'm going to set that aside.

What I do want to argue is that you can find some support for all of these in some game theory textbooks, and that combined they produce a plausible decision theory. While the textbooks don't all agree, for simplicity I'm going to focus on one book: Giacomo Bonanno's *Game Theory* [@Bonanno2018]. This book has two important virtues: it is philosophically deep, and it is available for free. It isn't hard to find a game theory text with one or other of these virtues, but few have both. So it will be our primary guide in what follows, along with some primary sources (most of which are referenced in that book).

Methodologically, this paper differs from most works in decision theory in two ways. It has been a commonplace since @Nozick1969 to include demons, who are arbitrarily good at predicting a decision, in problems. Some of the cases here will involve two such demons, each of which is arbitrarily good at predicting a decision, and whose errors are probabilistically independent. Second, I'm going to rely less on intuitions about particular cases, and more on intuitions that certain cases should be treated the same way. This makes sense given the history of the field. There is much less consensus about what to do in Newcomb problems than about which problems are Newcomb problems. Judgments, or intuitions if you prefer, about how to classify problems seem more stable and more reliable, and they will be central to this paper.

The conclusion of this paper is that a permissive version of causal ratificationism is correct. Ideal choosers make choices that they do not immediately regret. With two small caveats, that's all there is to decision theory; any ratifiable choice is one an ideal agent might make. The first caveat is to with choices over time; the ideal chooser will make choices such that both their individual choices, and the set of choices they make, are ratifiable. This will exclude some possible choices that are individually ratifiable. Second, the ideal chooser will not choose weakly dominated options. These are fairly minor caveats; the resulting theory is not very different from other forms of permissive causal ratificationism, such as that defended by Melissa @Fuscond.
