Bratman on diachronic rationality

(D):

The following is locally irrational: Intending at t1 to X at t2; throughout t1–t2 confidently taking one’s relevant grounds adequately to support this very intention; and yet at t2 newly abandoning this intention to X at t2. (140)

The quote is originally from his Planning, Time, and Self-Governanace. I found it in https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020174X.2019.1663014, Sergio's Self-Governance Over Time

Should include this in dual mandate
